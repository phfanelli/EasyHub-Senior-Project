# EasyHub-Senior-Project
Spring 2017 Senior Design Project


Welcome to EasyHub!

This started out as a Senior Design Project at West Virginia University. 

The motivation for this was to teach users new to version control how to use terminal/cmd version control system commands.

Our method of teaching comes from our Graphical User Interface of simple version control buttons that translates to the Terminal View.

We decided to build this around Electron because we like what they do. https://electron.atom.io/

We used Polymer (JavaScript Library) for our UI elements because we like them. https://www.polymer-project.org/

We also used NPM for package managing. https://www.npmjs.com/


If you have suggestions for improvement, feel free to let us know.
